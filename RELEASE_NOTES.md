## 🧪 Testing Instructions
To run this release locally:

### 1. Backend (Port 7071)
```bash
cd batchverse-backend
npm install
func start
```

### 2. Frontend (Port 8081)
```bash
cd batchverse-mobile
npm install
npx expo start
# Press 'i' for iOS Simulator or 'a' for Android Emulator
```

### 3. Test Credentials (Mock Mode)
*   **Admin User:** Any email ending in `@admin.com` (e.g., `test@admin.com`) automatically gets Admin privileges.
*   **Regular User:** Any other email (e.g., `user@batchverse.com`).
*   **Password:** Any string (Mock mode accepts all).

## 🐛 Known Issues / Limitations
*   **Data Persistence:** Backend runs in **Mock Mode** by default. Data resets on restart unless `SQL_CONNECTION_STRING` is configured in `local.settings.json`.
*   **Image Upload:** Currently accepts URL strings only; actual file upload to blob storage is pending Sprint 2.
*   **Push Notifications:** Not implemented in MVP.
